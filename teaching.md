I started helping with coaching ICPC teams at Madison (when I was not a participant) since Sept. 2019. I:

- Attended ICPC World Finals 2019 as a coach

### Peer mentoring
I was a peer mentor for the course "Introduction to Algorithms" in Spring 2019 at Madison, where I: 
- Designed and led group discussions on topics including greedy and dynamic programming
- Held individual help sessions for students to answer their questions on course material and algorithm design

### Mentorship Program
I have been a mentor since Sept. 2020 at the CUSA (Chinese Undergraduate Student Association) Mentorship Program, where I:
