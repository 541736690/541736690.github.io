## Hi!

I am Ziyi Zhang, a senior undergrad majoring in Computer Sciences and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin -Madison. It is my pleasure to be advised by [Prof. Shivaram Venkatarama](https://shivaram.org/) on system research and by [Prof. Dieter van Melkebeek](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/) on competitive programming.

My research interests lie in distributed systems and machine learning systems. The projects I worked on include low-level DNN operator accelerations, high-level ML system pipeline optimizations, and video processing system development. I am particularly interested in designing high-performance ML/Big Data Systems. 

Refer to my CV for things that I have done.

### News

\[2022/04\] I am going to UChicago for my PhD this fall!

## Research Projects

### Recommendation System
Recommendation models is prevalent these days for click rate prediction in big companies where they could be used to find the short videos/advertisement that users might be interested to see. We re-investigated the training process of recommendation system and make the training faster and less memory intensive for GPUs. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12429) 

### Competitive Programming

A (crazy) lot of time in my undergrad was devoted to competitive programming, and I am
- Champion (out of 180 teams) in 2019 ICPC NCNA Regional (scoreboard: link).
- 17th place (out of 118 teams) in 2020 ICPC World Finals (results: link).
- a coach and a participant in UW-Madison ICPC Team.
- International Grandmaster (highest rank 169 globally) on Codeforces (handle: RobeZH).

### Teaching/Mentoring Experience

I love teaching and mentoring students. My related activities includes:
- Undergrad Teaching Assistant for “Introduction to Algorithms”.
- Discussion leader in weekly meetings for UW-Madison ICPC Team.
- 1-on-1 mentorship at CUSA (Chinese Undergraduate Student Association).
