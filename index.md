## Hi!

![head](./imgs/head.jpg)


I am Ziyi Zhang, a senior undergrad majoring in Computer Sciences and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is my pleasure to be advised by [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/) on system research and by [Prof. Dieter van Melkebeek](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dieter/) on competitive programming.

My research interests lie in distributed systems and machine learning systems. The projects I worked on include low-level DNN operator accelerations, high-level ML system pipeline optimizations, and video processing system development. I am particularly interested in designing high-performance ML/Big Data Systems. 

Refer to my [CV](http://robezh.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cv_ziyizhang-1.pdf) for things that I have done.

### News

\[2022/04\] I am going to UChicago for my PhD this fall!

### Research Projects

#### Recommendation System
Recommendation models is prevalent these days for click rate prediction in big companies where they could be used to find the short videos/advertisement that users might be interested to see. We re-investigated the training process of recommendation system and make the training faster and less memory intensive for GPUs. [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12429) 

#### Future Projects
I will work closely with [Prof. Junchen Jiang](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~junchenj/) at UChicago. Let's see what will happen there!


### Competitive Programming

A (crazy) lot of time in my undergrad was devoted to competitive programming (also known as programming contests).

View my stories [here](./cp.html)!

### Teaching/Mentoring Experience

I love teaching and mentoring students. I have taken several related roles including ICPC coach, peer mentor, and 1-on-1 mentor. Check [this](./teaching.html) out for more information.
