## Hi!

I am Ziyi Zhang, a senior undergrad majoring in Computer Sciences and Mathematics at University of Wisconsin -Madison. It is my pleasure to be advised by Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman on system research and by Prof. Dieter van Melkebeek on competitive programming.

I took a gap year before my senior year and worked as a research intern at Bytedance Inc., where I was advised by Yibo Zhu and Bairen Yi.

My research interests lie in distributed systems and machine learning systems. The projects I worked on include low-level DNN operator accelerations, high-level ML system pipeline optimizations, and video processing system development. I am particularly interested in designing high-performance ML/Big Data Systems. I am actively looking for PhD positions that start in Fall 2022.

Refer to my CV for things that I have done.

### News

\[2022/04\] I am going to UChicago for my PhD this fall!
\[2021/10\] I, with my teammates, went to ICPC World Finals at Moscow and won the 17th place!
\[2020/09\] I am joining ByteDance as a research intern on machine learning system!

### Research Projects
I did various research projects both in my university and at ByteDance, including:
- Building video processing library to perform video DNN tasks.
- Optimizing DNN operators in model parallelism.
- Optimizing the performance of recommendation system models.

### Competitive Programming

A (crazy) lot of time in my undergrad was devoted to competitive programming, and I am
- Champion (out of 180 teams) in 2019 ICPC NCNA Regional (scoreboard: link).
- 17th place (out of 118 teams) in 2020 ICPC World Finals (results: link).
- a coach and a participant in UW-Madison ICPC Team.
- International Grandmaster (highest rank 169 globally) on Codeforces (handle: RobeZH).

### Teaching/Mentoring Experience

I love teaching and mentoring students. My related activities includes:
- Undergrad Teaching Assistant for “Introduction to Algorithms”.
- Discussion leader in weekly meetings for UW-Madison ICPC Team.
- 1-on-1 mentorship at CUSA (Chinese Undergraduate Student Association).
